# Dog rap (https://psi-rap.pl/)

At first, I have to say I'm a Java developer, not a frontend one.\
I wrote this app because of a charity action I organized to help animals. 

Production: [psi-rap](https://psi-rap.pl/)

A week after the action started, the war broke out in Ukraine and I completely gave up promoting this action. \
Therefore, it cannot be said to be a successful one. What's more, I made a number of marketing mistakes. \
"The marketing and promotion are easy" I thought. \
I was wrong. It is not. It turned out I'm a layman in this area. \
Despite the fact that the goal was not achieved, I consider it a valuable lesson. I know I would do better now!

To summarize, this is not a code that can be thought of as a benchmark. \
This is frontend code written by the backend developer :)
